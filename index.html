        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball 
        to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football 
        that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.

         <h3>Oceania</h3>
         <p>
          On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook
          (Djab Wurrung for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia,

        <h3>Calcio Fiorentino</h3>
        <p>
          In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as "calcio storico" ("historic kickball") in the Piazza Santa Croce.[45] The young aristocrats of the city would dress
           up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football.

        <h3>Clubs</h3>
        <p>
          Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[64][62]

          The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called "The Foot-Ball Club" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824â€“41.[65][66] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[66]
          
          In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.[67] This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.
